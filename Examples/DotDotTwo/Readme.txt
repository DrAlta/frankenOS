DotDotTwo is a small application for the Palm OS.  It's purpose 
is to put the device in debug-ready mode so the Metrowerks 
debugger can speak to it.  It does the programmatic equivalent 
of entering "'Shortcut' .. 2".  

Install DotDotTwo using the InstApp program.  I bind it to the 
ToDo list push button using the Preferences application making it
easy to launch for those late-night debugging sessions.

Version 1.0 has no user interface.  In fact, the only way you can 
tell it ran is that you may notice a short flash of the screen when 
you launch it.  You will still be in whatever application you were 
running before.

Version 2.0 has more user interface (i.e. a form with a button on
it).  It has not been thoroughly tested, and, in fact, several
people have told me they can't make it work on their older devices.
It works on my Professional, though, so it may work on yours.  Check
www.pilotgear.com for updates as they become available.  The button
in version 2.0 allows the user to reset the device.  I'm not sure
what use that will be for debugging, but it's easier than using a 
paperclip when you need to reset.

DotDotTwo is now supported by Palm, although Eric Cloninger (ericc@metrowerks.com),
originally wrote it.
