<h1>LispMe Manual</h1>
Ever wanted to carry a lisp machine in your shirt pocket? Now this is possible
with the LispMe Lisp system for the Pilot PDA... so much for marketing, which
isn't really necessary, as LispMe is Free Software published under
the <a href="COPYING.txt">GNU Public License</a>. Look
<a href="#synopsis">here</a> for an overview of LispMe's features.

  <h2>Why is LispMe now Free Software instead of shareware?</h2>
  There are several reasons for this change:
  <ul>
    <li>The abundance of poorly written software for the Pilot. Unfortunately
        nowadays even the simplest applications are shareware. There are 
        some simple hacks consisting of at most 100 lines of code, and the author
        is charging 5 or 10$! Some people seem to have forgotten
        what made the success of the PalmOS platform: An open API and
        free tools causing a huge software pool.
          
    <li>With the ever growing diversity of hardware and software versions
        for PalmOS, I'm no longer able to test every combination by myself.
        So, even with with detailed bug reports, I couldn't always 
        reproduce the problems other users had. 
    <li>Most implementations of Scheme are free and I feel obliged to
        their creators, as without them I wouldn't have learned this
        wonderful language.
    <li>Most of the tools used for creating LispMe are Free Software
        theirselves.
    <li>Finally, I hope all people who registered LispMe (and several
        paid much more than I originally requested!), accept this change
        and won't regret their investment. And many of them asked for
        the source code and gave me reasons why to contribute to the 
        Free Software resource pool.
  </ul>


<h1><a name="synopsis">Overview</a></h1>
  LispMe is a Scheme compiler and runtime system running on the
  <a href="http://palmpilot.3com.com/index.html">Pilot PDA</a>.
   It is mainly intended to  have a tool for quickly trying ideas
  and algorithms, but you can write dialog-based applications, too.<p>

  Features included:
  <ul>
    <li>Full-conforming Scheme semantics (static scoping, first-class closures,
        tail recursion, continuations ...)
    <li>mark/sweep garbage collection
    <li>integrated compiler
    <li>symbols, small integers, lists, booleans, chars, strings, vectors
    <li>full 8 byte double precision IEEE floating point for real and complex
        arithmetic including transcendental functions
    <li>delayed expressions
    <li>quasiquote, macros and eval
    <li>online help
    <li>statistics
    <li>graphics and full user interface support
    <li>ports using MemoPad memos as files
    <li>syntax-aware editing via Parentheses Hack
    <li>multiple workspaces/sessions
    <li>full source code available  
  </ul>

  Features omitted:
  <ul>
    <li>engines
    <li>dynamic/fluid binding
    <li>bigint and rational numeric types
    <li>a debugger
  </ul>

  For the top level, loading of sources etc. LispMe uses a unique concept not
  found in other similar systems but fitting (IMHO) very good to the 
  Pilot's "flavor".<p>

  LispMe uses the memo pad as source editor, so all your LispMe code is
  automatically backed up with hotsync and you can import/export source code
  like any other text with your desktop PC.<p>

  All LispMe memory is held in a database, so switching to other applications
  and restarting LispMe again is possible without destroying the current image.

  <h1><a name="legalese">Legal Stuff</a></h1>
  LispMe is released under the <a href="COPYING.txt">GNU Public License</a> and
  comes with <b>absolutely no warranty</b>.

  I take no responsibility for any damage this program may cause to your
  Pilot or your databases stored on your Pilot. You should <b>backup</b> your
  Pilot databases before installing LispMe.
  LispMe has been tested thoroughly on the Poser emulator, on my own
  Pilot 1000 with 1 meg RAM running System 2.04, my new Palm III
  running System 3.3, and several other
  Pilots PalmPilot Pro and different software/hack
  configurations and works fine.<p>

  MathLib is a free shared library that can be used by any OS 2.0 Pilot
  program that needs IEEE 754 double precision math functions. It's 
  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and
  is freely available with full source code and documentation at the
  <a href="http://www.probe.net/~rhuebner/mathlib.html">MathLib
  Information web page.</a> It's not
  a part of LispMe, and you're not paying anything for its use; a copy is
  simply included in this archive for your convenience.<p>

  Parentheses Hack is freeware! Why charging fees for a simple little
  hack that I wrote in one afternoon?<p>

  To use Parentheses Hack, you need to install HackMaster on your Pilot.
  You can get it <a href="http://www.daggerware.com/hackmstr.htm">here</a>.
  Please note that HackMaster is shareware, so you should register it.<p>
