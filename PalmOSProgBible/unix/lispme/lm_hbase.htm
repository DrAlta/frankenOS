<h1>LispMe HanDBase interface</h1>
  <a href="http://www.handbase.com">HanDBase</a> is a commercial
  database system for the Palm having a large customership. 
  It provides a simple API which LispMe supports now.<p>

  The data model of HanDBase is very simple: A table in the relational
  model is a "database" in HanDBase jargon. It consists of a number 
  of rows of identical format. Each record is identified by a number 
  in the range [0..<i>n-1</i>]<p>

  To access a field value, you have to specify database name, record
  number and field number. The function
  <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_hb_info"><tt>hb-info</tt></a> retrieves
  catalog information of a database like number of records and 
  types names and attributes of all fields.<p>

  There are no selection or filter functions, you have to traverse the
  entire database table to find a record.<p>

  Unfortunately, there's no clear distinction between internal and external
  data formats (all data is stored as strings in HanDBase),
  type conversion and 
  syntax checking is done in various places in HanDBase. These problems
  get worse, as the <i>formatted data</i> is stored, so databases using
  different locales are not easily exchangable. Have a look at the
  <a href="lm_samp.htm#hb_util">sample</a> how to parse the strings
  returned from HanDBase.<p>

  HanDBase provides limited relations between tables, i.e. a 
  1:n relationship. A record in table <i>A</i> can reference a set
  of records in table <i>B</i> and you can use the function
  <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_hb_getlinks"><tt>hb-getlinks</tt></a> to
  retrieve the entire set. Unfortunately there's no function to go backwards,
  i.e. find the owner of the current record.

<h2><a name="errors">HanDBase error codes</a></h2>
  HanDBase errors always cause this
  <a href="lm_err.htm#err_handbase_error">error message</a>.
  The error code included has the following meanings:<p>
  <table border>
    <tr><th>error code<th>description<th>remarks
    <tr><td>2<td>Couldn't find database<td>Names are case-sensitive
    <tr><td>3<td>Couldn't open database<td>
    <tr><td>4<td>Error reading record info<td>
    <tr><td>5<td>Error reading record<td>Index out of range 
    <tr><td>6<td>Not a link field<td>Can't use <tt>hb-getlinks</tt>
  </table><p>
  You should never see another error code, please
