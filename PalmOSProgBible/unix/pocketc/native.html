<h1>PocketC Native Libraries</h1>

<p>Creating native libraries allows a PocketC developer to write code that executes faster
than similar PocketC code. It also allows a user to expose functionality to a PocketC
applet that PocketC's built-in library does not provide. Such libraries can be released
for use by other developers, which helps the PocketC and Palm community.</p>

<p>This document does not cover aspects of PalmOS system libraries. In theory, all that
you need to know about system libraries to create a PocketC native library is either
included in the document, or is already written in the sample library. For more
information, check the PalmOS SDK.</p>

<p>Assuming you have a copy of CodeWarrior installed, creating native libraries is almost
trivial. Users who wish to use other tools, such as GCC, will need to do a little more
work. At this time, OrbWorks will provide no support for GCC developers since we have not
used or tested it. However, <a href="mailto:jeremy@rixon.org">Jeremy Rixon</a>
figured out how to do it and explains it here: <a href="http://rixon.org/FractalLib/index.html" EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://rixon.org/FractalLib/index.html</a>.</p>

<h3>There a few basic steps to create a PocketC library:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the PocketCLib project to a new directory into your CodeWarrior tree. Rename it
    whatever you like, and open it.</li>
  <li>Open the settings of the PocketCLib project, and change the output name and creator id.
    Creator ID's must be unique, so if you plan to release your library to the public, you
    must choose and register a unique ID with 3com. You may also need to change some of the
    include/lib paths.</li>
  <li>In PocketCLib.h:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add whatever globals you will to the <em>PocketCLibGlobalsType</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In PocketCLib.cpp:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add code to initialize your globals in <em>PocketCLibOpen</em>()</li>
    <li>Add code to cleanup your globals in <em>PocketCLibClose</em>()</li>
    <li>Write the routines that your library will export to PocketC</li>
    <li>Add function prototypes for your functions in <em>PocketCLibAddFunctions</em>()</li>
    <li>Add calls to your functions in the switch statement in <em>PocketCLibExecuteFunction</em>()</li>
  </ul>
  <li>No changes are needing in PocketCLibDispatch.cpp</li>
  <li>In PocketCLib.lib (description file for PocketC Desktop Edition):<ul>
      <li>List each function in the order that <em>PocketCLibAddFunctions</em>() enumerates them.</li>
      <li>For each function, declare it as you would in PocketC source code, followed by a
        semicolon rather than a function body.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compile and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h1>General Info</h1>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <em>value</em> is the C++ datatype that represents all PocketC datatypes in the form
of a union. A value has a <em>type</em> field, which describes the type of the <em>value</em>.
Only one of the other fields is used (based on the <em>type</em>). A type can be one of <em>vtInt,
vtFloat, vtChar, or vtString</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> A string is stored somewhere in dynamic memory, and a <em>value</em>
holds a <strong>handle</strong> to it, not a pointer. Once a <em>value</em> containing a
string is no longer needed, it must be deleted using the <em>cleanup</em>() function.</p>

<h3>Function Prototypes</h3>

<p>A function declaration (created with a call to <em>addFunc</em>() ) consists of a name,
a number of arguments, and a list of up to ten argument types. The arguments may be one of
the standard types or can be of type <em>vmVoid</em>. A parameter of type <em>vmVoid</em>
means that the compiler will not cast the parameter that is passed. In other words, the
user can pass in any type of value, and no conversion is automatically performed.</p>

<h3>The Stack</h3>

<p>PocketC pushes all parameters on the the stack in the order they appear in the function
declaration. So, a function declared with two parameters [func(int x, int y)] will have
the x pushed on the stack first, followed by the y. Therefore, the first value popped off
the stack will be the y.</p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>

<p>A function set the return value by setting the global variable <em>retVal</em>. When
PocketC calls the library, the return value is set to <em>type=vtInt</em>, <em>vtInt=0</em>.</p>

<h3>The C++ function</h3>

<p>The C++ function that implements your PocketC library function will take only one
parameter, a pointer to the global data. It will obtain the PocketC parameters by using
the <em>pop</em>() function and will call <em>cleanup</em>() on all string parameters.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Standard Library Exports</h1>

<h3><em>PocketCLibOpen</em>()</h3>

<p>This function is called both at compile and run time. This function should set up your
globals and return a pointer to you <strong>locked</strong> globals. The function pointers
in the global structure are filled in <strong>after</strong> this call, so they are not
yet available.</p>

<h3><em>PocketCLibClose</em>()</h3>

<p>This function is called both at compile and run time. This function should free the
global structure.</p>

<h3><em>PocketCLibAddFunctions</em>()</h3>

<p>This function is called only at compile time. This function should add function
prototypes by calling <em>addFunc</em>(). The first function added is given an index of 0.</p>

<h3><em>PocketCLibExecuteFunction</em>()</h3>

<p>This function is called only at runtime. The function should contain a switch statement
which calls your C++ functions to process the PocketC function call. The index of the
functions must match the order in which they were added in <em>PocketCLibAddFunctions</em>().</p>

<h1>Global Functions</h1>

<h3><em>pop</em>(Value&amp;)</h3>

<p>pops a value off the stack. If it is a string value, you must call <em>cleanup</em>()
on it when you are finished using it.</p>

<h3><em>push</em>(Value&amp;)</h3>

<p>pushes a value on the stack. The value is copied to the stack. If it is a string, the
string is also copied, so you must call <em>cleanup</em>() on the original value after you
push it on the stack.</p>

<h3><em>cleanup</em>(Value&amp;)</h3>

<p>Frees the memory held by a string value. If the value is not a string, no processing is
done. (i.e. it is always safe to call <em>cleanup</em>(), even when not needed).</p>

<h3><em>typeCast</em>(Value&amp;, VarType)</h3>

<p>Casts a value to the given type. If the new value is a string, it must be freed when no
longer needed. If the original value is a string which is converted to another type, the
string is freed automatically.</p>

<h3><em>typeMatch</em>(Value&amp;, Value&amp;)</h3>

<p>Casts both values to a matching type. For example, when this function is called with a
float and an int, the int is cast to a float. If one is a string, the other is cast to a
string.</p>

<h3><em>UIYield</em>(bool blocking)</h3>

<p>Allows the system to process PalmOS events. This function also sets up the return
values for the PocketC <em>event</em>() function and processing PalmOS events on behalf of
PocketC. You must call this if your operation will take a while. If the <em>blocking</em>
parameter is true, a single PalmOS event will be processed. If none are available, the
system will wait for one. If <em>blocking</em> is false, the system will process all
waiting messages and return.</p>

<h3><em>callFunc</em>(int location)</h3>

<p>Calls the PocketC function at address <em>location</em>. Before this call, you must
push the parameters on the stack (in the order of the function's parameter list). You can
obtain the address of a function by accessing it in your PocketC source code <strong>without</strong>
parentheses. (e.g. puts(main); will print the address of the function main). This function
cannot be used to call PocketC's built in functions. Calling this function recursively is
not very smart.</p>

<p><strong>Important: </strong>The function's return value is placed on the stack. You
must pop it off the stack after it has been called. A call to this function will modify <em>retVal</em></p>

<h3><em>callBI</em>(char* name)</h3>

<p>Calls the built-in PocketC function with the given name. Before this call, you must
push the parameters on the stack (in the order of the function's parameter list). The
function's return value is placed in <em>retVal</em>. So if it returns a string, you must
clean it up (by calling <em>cleanup()</em>) before you overwrite <em>retVal</em>. This
function returns false if the function is not found.</p>

<h3><em>deref</em>(int ptr)</h3>

<p>Dereferences a PocketC pointer, returning a <em>Value*</em> which points to the memory
to which the pointer refers. Remember, this is a pointer to the actual value, not a copy
of it. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Using Native Libaries</h1>

<p>To use a native library in a PocketC applet, you must instruct the compiler to load the
library's functions. This is done through the library keyword.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>// My Applet
library &quot;PocketCLib&quot;

main() {
   int x;
   x = times5(7);
}</pre>

<p>The name of a library function cannot be the same as a user function. However, it may
be the same as the name of a builtin function. In this case, the compiler will generate
calls to the native library function rather than the builtin function.</p>
