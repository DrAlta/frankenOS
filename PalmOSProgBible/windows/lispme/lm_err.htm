<h1>LispMe Error Messages</h1>

<!***************************************************************************>
<!*** Syntax errors *********************************************************>
<!***************************************************************************>

<h2><a name="err_syntax">Syntax Errors</a></h2>
  When a syntax error is found during loading a memo, you go back to
  the <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_load">load dialog</a>. Now you can use the
  <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_edit">Edit button</a> to jump directly to the
  offending source text to correct your mistake.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_char">Invalid char</a></h3>
    The LispMe reader encountered an invalid character.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_sexp">Invalid symbolic expression</a></h3>
    The LispMe reader encountered a token that cannot start a valid
    symbolic expression. This also happens, when the expression to be read
    is empty.
 
  <h3><a name="err_multi_dot">Multiple dots in list</a></h3>
    More than one dot <tt>.</tt> occurred in a list, or more than
    one expression is written after the dot. Make sure that you
    didn't put a space into a floating point constant.

  <h3><a name="err_token_len">Max. token length exceeded</a></h3>
    A single token (a symbol, number or string) must not contain more than
    256 characters.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_real">Invalid real number</a></h3>
    The LispMe reader encountered an invalid floating point constant.
    Possible reasons are:<ul>
    <li>neither a digit or <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> after the <tt>e</tt>
        in the exponent part
    <li>not a digit after the <tt>e</tt> and sign
        in the exponent part
    <li>not a digit after the decimal point
    </ul>

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_complex">Invalid complex number</a></h3>
    The LispMe reader encountered an invalid complex number.
    Possible reasons are:<ul>
    <li>You forgot the <tt>i</tt> after the imaginary part
    <li>You didn't put a space between two real numbers, so LispMe
        tried to interpret the second as the imaginary part of a complex.
    </ul>

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_hash">Invalid # constant</a></h3>
    This error occurres, when there's an illegal character after
    the hash sign <tt>#</tt> in a constant. The only allowed <tt>#</tt>
    constants are <ul>
    <li><a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_false"><tt>#f</tt></a> the constant <i>false</i>
    <li><a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_true"><tt>#t</tt></a> the constant <i>true</i>
    <li><a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_noprint"><tt>#n</tt></a> the non-printing value
    <li><tt>#(</tt>, introducing a vector.
    <li><tt>#\</tt>, introducing a character constant.
    </ul>
    Additionally, this error is raised when in a string containing
    hex escape sequences <tt>#<i>hh</i></tt> one of the characters
    <tt><i>h</i></tt> is not a hexadecimal digit.

  <h3><a name="err_unterm_string">Unterminated string</a></h3>
    When writing a string constant, you forgot the closing double quote
    <tt>"</tt>. Perhaps you wanted to include a <tt>"</tt> in the
    string and forgot to escape it with <tt>\</tt>. Or the last char
    in the string is a <tt>\</tt> and you forgot to escape it, resulting
    in an escaped double quote.

<!*** Compiler errors *******************************************************>
<!***************************************************************************>

<h2>Compiler Errors</h2>

  When a memo is syntactically correct, no more source positions are 
  recorded. So, if there's a compiler error, LispMe hasn't enough 
  information to find the offending position in the source text. Thus when
  pressing the
  <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_edit">Edit button</a> after an unsuccessfull
  load, you simply go to the beginning of the selected memo.

  <h3><a name="err_undef">Undefined name</a></h3>
    The given name is not defined in the lexical environment. Check for
    a spelling error or for having loaded all required memos.

  <h3><a name="err_num_args">Wrong number of arguments</a></h3>
    The number of arguments for the noted special form or built-in
    procedure is wrong.

  <h3><a name="err_not_symbol"><i>expr</i> is not a symbol</a></h3>
    <i>expr</i> was found, when there was a variable name expected in
    the special forms
    <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_define"><tt>define</tt></a>,
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_let"><tt>let</tt></a>,
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_letrec"><tt>letrec</tt></a>, or
    <a href="lm_cat4.htm#desc_set"><tt>set!</tt></a>.

  <h3><a name="err_inv_let_list">Invalid let list</a></h3>
    The head (variable binding list) in a
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_let"><tt>let</tt></a> or
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_letrec"><tt>letrec</tt></a> form is
    not a proper list.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_let">Invalid let binding</a></h3>
    A variable binding in the head of a
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_let"><tt>let</tt></a> or
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_letrec"><tt>letrec</tt></a> form is
    not a two-element list <tt>(<i>var expr</i>)</tt>.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_lambda">Invalid lambda args</a></h3>
    The argument list for the
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_lambda"><tt>lambda</tt></a> special
    form has not one the three allowed shapes. This also applies to
    the second form of <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_define"><tt>define</tt></a>.

  <h3><a name="err_improper_args">Improper argument list</a></h3>
    An expression list in a function call is not a proper list.

  <h3><a name="err_duplicate_name">Duplicate name</a></h3>
    A variable name to be bound occurred twice in a
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_lambda"><tt>lambda</tt></a>-,
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_let"><tt>let</tt></a>- or
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_letrec"><tt>letrec</tt></a>-binding
    list. Also when the same toplevel name is defined twice in a
    loaded memo.

  <h3><a name="err_empty_sequence">Empty expression sequence</a></h3>
    An expression sequence in the body of a
    <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_begin"><tt>begin</tt></a>-,
    <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_cond"><tt>cond</tt></a>-,
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_lambda"><tt>lambda</tt></a>-,
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_let"><tt>let</tt></a>- or
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_letrec"><tt>letrec</tt></a>-form is
    empty. It must contain at least one expression.

  <h3><a name="err_wrong_define">Definition in invalid context</a></h3>
    A <tt>define</tt> expression is not
    allowed in this context. Definitions must appear before all other
    expressions in an expression sequence.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_define">Invalid definition</a></h3>
    A definition (see <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_define"><tt>define</tt></a>)
    has not of one of the allowed shapes.

  <h3><a name="err_not_define">Not only 'define' expressions in loaded memo</a></h3>
    A memo to be loaded must consist of a sequence of
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_define"><tt>define</tt></a> forms. No other
    expressions are allowed.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_cond">Invalid case/cond clause</a></h3>
    A <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_case"><tt>case</tt></a> or
    <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_cond"><tt>cond</tt></a>
    clause is not of the form
    <tt>(<i>guard expr<sub>1</sub> expr<sub>2</sub> ...</i>)</tt>.

  <h3><a name="err_too_complex">Expression too complex</a></h3>
    An expression to be compiled is too deeply nested. To avoid stack
    overflow (and thus a Fatal Error) in the compiler, this message is
    displayed. Try to simplify your code by using helper functions for
    example.

  <h3><a name="err_macro">Macro too complex</a></h3>
    For technical reasons, compilation can't be interrupted by the
    <a href="lm_cmd.htm#ctl_break">Break button</a>. So, to avoid infinite
    loops while compiling, there are two fixed limits for expanding a
    macro (which indeed calls the VM for its duty):
    <ul>
      <li>The number of VM steps for a single expansion. This is 1600,
          which should suffice to distinguish between sensible macros
          and non-termination.
      <li>The number of macro expansion during a single compilation. This
          is 200 which should also suffice.
    </ul>
    If you should encounter a situation where these limits are too tight,
    please send me an <a href="mailto:bugs@lispme.de">email</a> including
    the code you tried to compile, but watch out for non-terminating macros
    like <tt>(macro (defunct x) x)</tt> before.

  <h3><a name="err_unquote">unquote(-splicing) invalid outside of quasiquote</a></h3>
    One of the special forms
    <a href="lm_cat4.htm#desc_unquote"><tt>unquote</tt></a> or
    <a href="lm_cat4.htm#desc_unquotesplicing"><tt>unquote-splicing</tt></a>
    appeared outside of the special form
    <a href="lm_cat3.htm#desc_quasiquote"><tt>quasiquote</tt></a> or the
    nesting depth of quasiquote expressions has reached zero by outer
    unquotes.

  <h3><a name="err_splice">unquote-splicing allowed in list or vector
      template only</a></h3>
    <a href="lm_cat4.htm#desc_unquotesplicing"><tt>unquote-splicing</tt></a>
    didn't appear in a list or a vector template, so there wouldn't be a
    valid context into which the resulting list could be spliced.

<!*** Runtime errors ********************************************************>
<!***************************************************************************>

<h2>Runtime Errors</h2>
  <h3><a name="err_wrong_type"><i>expr</i> is not a <i>type</i></a></h3>
    This is the classical runtime type error. This error is also raised, when
    a number is to large to be coerced to an integer by
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_integer"><tt>integer</tt></a>

  <h3><a name="err_num_args_rt">Function expected <i>n</i> arguments, but
      got <i>m</i> as follows: <i>expr</i></a></h3>
    A lexical closure expecting <i>n</i> arguments was called with a
    wrong number of arguments, namely <i>m</i>. The actual argument list
    is printed in this error message as <i>expr</i>.

  <h3><a name="err_div_by_zero">Division by zero</a></h3>
    Caused by integer and floating point division.

  <h3><a name="err_black_hole">Sucked into black hole</a></h3>
    During evaluation of the local definitions in a
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_letrec"><tt>letrec</tt></a> form, the
    value of one of the variables just being bound was accessed. An access
    to the value of any variable in the binding list will cause this error
    while the expressions to initialize these variables are evaluated.
    These variables may be used inside a
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_lambda"><tt>lambda</tt></a> or
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_delay"><tt>delay</tt></a> special form, as
    in this case their value will not be needed during evaluation of these
    forms.

  <h3><a name="err_cond_clause">No matching case/cond clause</a></h3>
    All of the guards in a <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_cond"><tt>cond</tt></a>
    form evaluated to <i>false</i> or the value of the expression
    in a <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_case"><tt>case</tt></a>
    form is not in any of the constant lists. Both cases can only happen,
    when the <tt>else</tt> keyword is absent.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_index">Invalid index</a></h3>
    The given expression is not a valid index for the string or vector.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_comp">Non-matching types in comparison</a></h3>
    The two objects compared by one of the procedures
    <a href="lm_cat1.htm#desc_compare"><tt>&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=</tt></a>
    have non-compatible types.

  <h3><a name="err_no_mathlib">Can't call transcendental functions without
      MathLib</a></h3>
    The mathematics library <tt>MathLib.prc</tt> (included in this package) has not
    been installed, so calls to transcendental functions like
    <a href="lm_cat4.htm#desc_sin"><tt>sin</tt></a> fail. The functions
    needing MathLib are marked in the
    <a href="lm_cat1.htm">Catalog of Language Elements</a>.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_parm">Invalid parameter <i>parm</i> for <i>proc</i></a></h3>
    The parameter <var>parm</var> is invalid for the built-in 
    procedure <var>proc</var>. Have a look at the catalog for valid arguments.

  <h3><a name="err_create_file">Can't create memo</a></h3>
    A new memo can't be created for output. Probably there's not enough
    memory left on your Pilot.

  <h3><a name="err_open_file">Memo not found</a></h3>
    The memo to be opened for input can't be found. Look for a spelling
    error in the memo name (this is always the first line of the memo).

  <h3><a name="err_lost_file">Memo associated with port vanished</a></h3>
    A memo which is currently open (either for reading or writing) has
    been deleted. Just simply don't do that!

  <h3><a name="err_write_file">Can't write to memo</a></h3>
    LispMe can't resize the memo to append the output. Probably there's
    not enough memory left on your Pilot.

  <h3><a name="err_illegal_op">Illegal opcode</a></h3>
    The LispMe virtual machine (VM) encountered an illegal opcode. This is
    a severe internal error produced by a buggy LispMe compiler
    (you should <b>never</b> see this error message),
    so please send mail to <a href="mailto:bugs@lispme.de">me</a> with a
    report what caused this message.<p>
    However, if you got this error by messing around with the list returned
    by <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_disasm"><tt>disasm</tt></a>, this is
    your own fault, so don't blame me.

<!*** Memory errors *********************************************************>
<!***************************************************************************>

<h2>Memory Errors</h2>

  <h3><a name="err_create_sess">Can't create session <i>name</i></a></h3>
    The database for the new session <i>name</i> couldn't be created. There
    are several reasons for that, which are indicated within this error
    message:
    <ul>
      <li><b>invalid name:</b>The name given is not a valid Pilot database
        name. Using only letters and digits for the name (embedded spaces
        could cause problems on Hotsync) should help.
      <li><b>already exists:</b>A database with name <i>name</i> already exists
        on your Pilot. Not only LispMe databases must have unique names, they
        mustn't be the same as any other application or database on your
        Pilot. Sess <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_nsess">here</a> for details.
      <li><b>general error:</b>any other error occurred. Most probably you haven't
        enough memory left to create the new session database.
    </dl>

  <h3><a name="err_create_icon">Couldn't create icon</a></h3>
    The mini-application, which starts LispMe with the session database, 
    could not be created. Probably you don't have enough memory left on your
    Pilot, or (less probable) an application with this name already exists.
    See <a href="lm_sess.htm#db_names">here</a> about database naming
    issues.

  <h3><a name="err_string_full">Atom space exhausted</a></h3>
    There's not enough memory for a new symbol to be allocated. Symbols are
    not garbage collected, so this error may occur if you loaded and popped
    several different memos, as all symbols used so far accumulate in the
    atom space. So use the command <a href="lm_cmd.htm#men_reset">Reset Heap</a>,
    or if this doesn't help, increase the atom size via the
    <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_sizes">Memory sizes dialog</a>.

  <h3><a name="err_no_heap">Heap exhausted</a></h3>
    The heap memory used for lists and program code is exhausted and even
    garbage collection cannot reclain sufficient space.
    Look for non-terminating recursion or try to increase heap size via the
    <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_sizes">Memory sizes dialog</a>.

  <h3><a name="err_no_reals">FP storage exhausted</a></h3>
    The memory used for floating point values is exhausted and even
    garbage collection cannot reclain sufficient space.
    Try to increase FP size via the
    <a href="lm_cmd.htm#frm_sizes">Memory sizes dialog</a>.

  <h3><a name="err_no_list">No memory for list items</a></h3>
    The memory for the items in a user interface list set by
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_lst_set_list"><tt>lst-set-list</tt></a>
    couldn't be allocated. There's no dynamic heap memory left.

  <h3><a name="err_no_vector">Can't create vector</a></h3>
    The vector couldn't be allocated as a DB record in the LispMe DB, all
    DB heap has been used.

  <h3><a name="err_no_string">Can't create string</a></h3>
    The string couldn't be allocated as a DB record in the LispMe DB, all
    DB heap has been used.

  <h3><a name="err_stack_over">Recursion too deep</a></h3>
    This message can have three causes:
    <ul>
      <li>reading a deeply nested list (about 30 levels deep)
      <li>compiling a very complex expression
      <li>garbage-collecting a deeply nested list (about 50 levels)
    </ul>
    All these things are done internally by recursive functions consuming
    some of the (very limited!) Pilot hardware stack. To avoid overwriting
    memory and crashing your machine, a stack check caused this error.<p>
    Don't confuse this with recursive functions in LispMe itself, they
    <b>don't</b> use the hardware stack but the heap, so a non-terminating
    (non-tail) recursion in LispMe causes
     <a href="#err_no_heap">this error</a>.<p>
    You may sometimes get this error when loading a memo (the compiler
    needs some stack) and a garbage collection is invoked (needing further
    stack). Tap <i>Cancel</i> in this case and invoke
    <i>Menu/View/Memory usage</i>, which forces a garbage collection and
    try to load the memo again.

  <h3><a name="err_size_change">Couldn't change ... size</a></h3>
    An attempt to resize the memory block for heap, atoms, reals or output
    failed. You might not have enough free memory or your memory is too
    fragmented. The previous memory size is used. As during changing
    the memory size temporarily memory for <b>both</b> old and new block
    is needed, you can try to avoid this bottleneck by first changing to
    the smallest possible size, leave the dialog, re-enter it, and now change
    to the originally desired size.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_ptr">Invalid pointer</a></h3>
    A pointer in the LispMe heap has an invalid type tag. This is
    a severe internal error produced by a buggy LispMe compiler or VM
    (you should <b>never</b> see this error message),
    so please send mail to <a href="mailto:bugs@lispme.de">me</a> with a
    report what caused this message.

<!*** User interface errors *************************************************>
<!***************************************************************************>

<h2>User Interface Errors</h2>

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_form">Form <i>id</i> not found</a></h3>
    The form specified in a
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_frm_popup"><tt>frm-popup</tt></a> or
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_frm_goto"><tt>frm-goto</tt></a> call
    does not exist. Perhaps you opened the wrong resource DB with
    <a href="lm_cat4.htm#desc_set_resdb"><tt>set-resdb</tt></a>?

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_obj">Object <i>id</i> not in form</a></h3>
    The <i>id</i> given does not denote an object in the current form.
    Look for a typing mistake or for having attached the wrong handler
    to the form.

  <h3><a name="err_watchdog">Too much time in event handler</a></h3>
    Your event handler needed more time than allowed to process an
    event. Maybe you wrote an endless loop?

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_resdb"><i>name</i> is not a resource database</a></h3>
    Either no database <i>name</i> exists on your Pilot, or it is a normal
    DB (<tt>.pdb</tt>) not a resource DB (<tt>.prc</tt>).

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_kind">Object <i>id</i> is not a <i>kind</i></a></h3>
    The user interface object with this <i>id</i> in the current form is
    not of the right kind, e.g. you tried to use a field function like
    <tt>fld-set-text</tt> with a pushbutton.

  <h3><a name="err_invalid_goto">Can't call frm-goto now</a></h3>
    A <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_frm_goto"><tt>frm-goto</tt></a> call is
    not allowed until 
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_frm_popup"><tt>frm-popup</tt></a> has been
    called once at least.

  <h3><a name="err_form_nest">Forms nested too deeply</a></h3>
    No more than 6 nested calls of
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_frm_popup"><tt>frm-popup</tt></a> are allowed
    for memory reasons. (The PalmOS UI guidelines ...)
    You should use
    <a href="lm_cat2.htm#desc_frm_goto"><tt>frm-goto</tt></a> to switch
    between forms at the same level.

  <h3><a name="err_incomp_sess">Incompatible session</a></h3>
    The internal format of the session database selected doesn't match
    the format of the session databases used by the installed LispMe version.
    You either installed a newer version of LispMe without deleting older
    session DBs or you installed a 3rd-party LispMe app in an old format.
    In this ask for either an updated session DB or (better) for the source 
    code.

  <h3><a name="err_sess_miss">Can't start session <i>name</i></a></h3>
    The session name recorded within the LispMe starter application doesn't
    exist anymore or the session has a format incompatible with the 
    LispMe version installed. This can happen when you deleted the session database
    with a third party tool, but didn't touch the starter app itself,
    or when you transferred only the starter app without the session database.
    Another possibility is that you installed a newer LispMe version and 
    didn't delete any older sessions.
    See <a href="lm_sess.htm#start_app">here</a> how sessions and
    starter applications work.

  <h3><a name="err_reload">No memo loaded previously</a></h3>
    The <a href="lm_cmd.htm#ctl_reload">reload</a> command can't be used for one of these reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>no memo has been loaded yet
      <li>the last environment frame results from an interactive <tt>define</tt>
      <li>a <a href="lm_cmd.htm#ctl_pop">pop</a>  command has already removed the last memo
    </ul>
    Just use the ordinary <a href="lm_cmd.htm#ctl_load">load</a> button in this case.

  <h3><a name="err_no_lispme">LispMe not installed</a></h3>
    This message is not from LispMe itself (obviously :-), but from
    orphan starter applications which have been left after removing LispMe.
    You can delete them, too, or (better) re-install LispMe!

<h2>Warnings and user queries</h2>

  <h3><a name="err_user_info">User message: ...</a></h3>
    This message box (notice <b>User message</b> in the title bar)
    is generated by
    a call to the <a href="lm_cat3.htm#desc_message"><tt>message</tt></a>
    procedure. The text printed in the message box is the argument to
    <tt>message</tt>.

  <h3><a name="err_o6_confirm">Zap all LispMe memory?</a></h3>
    Tap <b>OK</b> to re-initialize LispMe memory. All loaded memos and other
    data will be cleared and you'll have a virgin heap.
    Tap <b>Cancel</b> if you selected

  <h3><a name="err_output_trunc">Output too long - truncated</a></h3>
    Your current evaulation created a lot of output (either by

    Output Size, will be omitted and the last character visible in the
    output field will be a <tt>...</tt> to indicate truncation.

<!*** Fatal errors **********************************************************>
<!***************************************************************************>

<h2>Fatal Errors</h2>
  OK, these errors are not fatal for your Pilot, but for LispMe. LispMe
  can't continue to work when one of these errors occurred.

  <h3>Can't create LispMe DB</h3>
    When starting LispMe the first time, it tries to create its database
    containing heap etc. memory. When this fails, LispMe can't work. You
    should delete some applications or databases to have more memory or
    use a defragmentation tool if your memory is too fragmented (not with 
    PalmOS3).

  <h3>No memoDB?</h3>
    The MemoPad database was not found. Now this is very strange...
