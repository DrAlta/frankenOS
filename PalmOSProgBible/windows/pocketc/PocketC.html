<p>PocketC is a PalmPilot-based compiler that can take source code from a memo and compile
it to bytecode that will run in the PocketC virtual machine. Currently there is no way to
create a standalone application with PocketC (the PocketC application is required to run
any applet that you create.</p>

<p>PocketC version 3.7 (with which this file came) is shareware with registration
available at <a href="http://www2.viaweb.com/pilotgearsw/orbworks.html">PalmGear HQ</a>.<br>
The latest version will always be available at the <a href="http://www.orbworks.com/">OrbWorks</a>
homepage. In addition to the joy and pride that registration provides, registered users
also have access to special tools, such as a .prc builder. See the <a
href="http://www.orbworks.com/">OrbWorks</a> website for more info.</p>

<h3>Installing an Applet</h3>

<p>Applets are installed the same way normal applications are installed. Run the Palm
Install Tool, select the applet database you want to install, and HotSync. </p>

<h3>Installing Source Code</h3>

<p>Source code can be copied from your computer by running the Palm Desktop application,
creating a new memo, and copying the source code to the new memo. </p>

<h3>Writing an Applet</h3>

<p>A PocketC applet is written as a memopad record. The first line of the record must be a
comment (//-style) which states the name of the applet.<br>
Example: <code>&#147;// Hello World&#148;</code>.<br>
<br>
You may also write source code on your computer, copy it to a memo (with the Palm Desktop
software), and Hotsync. </p>

<h3>Compiling an Applet</h3>

<p>Press the Compile&#133; button. Select the memo that you would like to compile, and
press Compile. An alert will popup either informing you that the compiliation was
successful or will indicate the location and type of the first error. </p>

<h3>Executing an Applet</h3>

<p>Select a compiled applet from the list, and press Execute. The Output form will open,
and your applet will run. When the applet exits (either normally or by pressing the Done
button), the main form reappears. To switch back to the Output form, press the output
button. </p>

<h3>Backing Up an Applet</h3>

<p>Backing up an applet is a way to share the compiled form of an applet without sharing
the source. To backup an individual applet, select it from the main form, and choose
&#145;Backup...&#146; from the Applet menu. The applet will be backed up at the next
HotSync. </p>

<h3>Deleting a User-Database</h3>

<p>Some applets will create databases to store preferences or other useful data. However,
if you delete an applet, you may also want to delete the database(s) that it created. To
do this, select the Applet|Databases... menu item. A list of user databases will be
presented. Press the Delete... button to delete the selected database. </p>
