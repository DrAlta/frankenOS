<h1>PocketC Language</h1>

<p>First, PocketC is a case sensitive language, meaning that typing <em>word</em> is not
the same as type <em>Word</em>.</p>

<p>There are three elements to a PocketC applet: the title line, the global variables, and
the functions. </p>

<h2>The Title</h2>

<p>The title is by far the easiest part of the PocketC language. The first line of your
applet is two slashes followed by the name of your applet. Example:</p>

<p><code>// My Applet</code></p>

<p>This is also known as a <b>comment</b>. Anytime the compiler finds '<code>//</code>' in
your applet, it will ignore the rest of the line that it is on. This allows you to place
explanatory text in your applet. There is one other way to put a comment in your applet,
by surrounding the text with '<code>/* */</code>'. This method allows you to spread a
comment out over several lines. Example:</p>

<pre>/* This is a multi-line comment.
All the text between the
asterisks is ignored */</pre>

<p>Multi-line comments are not nestable. In other words: </p>

<pre>/* comment1 /* comment2 */ a=b+c; */</pre>

<p>is NOT valid. </p>

<h2>The Global Variables</h2>

<p>Variables are the things that are used to store values in a program. There are four
types of variables in PocketC: </p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>integer (32-bit, signed)</td>
    <td><code>int</code></td>
    <td><code>1, 2, 5, -789, 452349</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>floating point (32-bit)</td>
    <td><code>float</code></td>
    <td><code>-1.2, 3.141592, 5.7e-4</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>characters (8-bit, signed)</td>
    <td><code>char</code></td>
    <td><code>'a', 'b', '#'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>strings</td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td><code>&quot;Bob&quot; &quot;Katie&quot; &quot;Hello&quot;</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pointers</td>
    <td><code>pointer</code></td>
    <td>discussed later</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> String constants may only be 255 characters. To strore a longer
string in a variable, use addition: <code>str = &quot;long1...&quot; +
&quot;long2...&quot;;</code> </p>

<p>Variables are declared like this:<br>
<i>variable-type name</i>[,<i>name</i>...];</p>

<p>Here are a few examples: </p>

<pre><b>int</b> myInteger, row, column;
<b>string</b> name;
<b>float</b> pi;
<b>char</b> c, last, first;
<b>pointer</b> ptr;</pre>

<p>It is also possible to have an <i>array</i> of values. An array is a list of values
that are stored in one variable. Arrays are declared like normal variables except that the
variable name is followed by '<code>[<i>size</i>]</code>' where <i>size</i> is the number
of item that the variable can hold. A declaration might look like this: </p>

<pre><b>int</b> values[10];
<b>string</b> names[7];</pre>

<p>Of course, arrays and normal variables can be declared together: </p>

<pre><b>int</b> row, values[10], column;
<b>string</b> name, colors[8];</pre>

<p>You can also give default values to the variables: </p>

<pre><b>int</b> nine = 9, eight = 8, zero;
<b>string</b> days[7] = { &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Mon&quot;, &quot;Tues&quot; };</pre>

<p>In the case of arrays, the initials values must be in braces and separated by
commas. If the number of values in the initializer list is less than the length
of the array, then the uninitialized elements have default values. For the <code>days</code>
array above, the last 4 members of <code>days</code> are the empty string (&quot;&quot;). </p>

<p>We'll discuss variables a little more later. </p>

<h2>The Functions</h2>

<p>Functions are the most important part of a program because they contain the actual
instructions that make a program useful. All functions have a name and a parameter list
(which may be empty) and are declared like the:<br>
<code><i>func-name</i>(</code>[<code><i>param-type param-name</i>,...</code>]<code>) { <i>statements</i>
}</code></p>

<p>Statements are discussed later, but for now, here are a few examples: </p>

<pre>area(int width, int height) {
   return width * height;
}

square(float x) {
   return x * x;
}

five() {
   return 5;
}</pre>

<p>There is one special function name which all programs must have: <code>main</code>. The
<code>main</code> function is the function which is called first in your program. When the
<code>main</code> function exits, the program terminates. The <code>main</code> function
must be declared with no paramters: </p>

<pre>// My Applet
main() {
   puts(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>Functions can also have local variables, which are variables that can only be accessed
within the function that declares them. Global variables, however, can be accessed from
anywhere. Local variables are declared in the same way that global variables are except
that they immediately follow the opening brace of a function: </p>

<pre>// My Applet
main() {
   string localString;

   localString = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
   puts(localString);
}</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you are creating large arrays, it is best to make them global
variables instead of local variable is possible.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Before we go any further, we need to talk a little bit about expressions. </p>

<h3>Expressions</h3>

<p>An expression is any number of constants, variables, and function calls connected by
operators and parentheses.</p>

<p>A <b>constant</b> is any value that is directly entered into the program, such as: <code>5
5.4 'a' &quot;String&quot;</code></p>

<p>A value stored in a <b>variable</b> can be accessed by just typing its name: <code>myInteger
name</code><br>
However, if that variable is an array, each value must be accessed individually by index.
The valid indices for a given array are 0 to <i>n</i>-1 where <i>n</i> is the number of
values in the array. So an array declared: </p>

<pre>string names[4]</pre>

<p>can be accessed like so: </p>

<pre>names[0] = &quot;first name&quot;;
names[1] = &quot;second name&quot;;
names[2] = &quot;third name&quot;;
names[3] = &quot;fourth name&quot;;</pre>

<p>A <b>function call</b> consists of the name of a function, followed by an open paren,
the parameter list, and a closing paren: </p>

<pre>area(5, 7);
square(8.9);
clear();
text(30, 55, &quot;Game Over&quot;);</pre>

<p>A function can only be called after it is defined. If you want to call a function
before defining it, you can use a function prototype. A prototype of a function is a
global line (not within another function) which states the name and parameters of a
function followed by a semicolon:</p>

<pre>area(int x, int y);
square(float); // the use of variable names is optional in a declaration</pre>

<p>These three basic elements can be combined with operators: </p>

<pre>5 + 7 - area(12, 34);
square(5) * pi;
&quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;World&quot;;</pre>

<p>Of course, function calls can have expressions in them as well: </p>

<pre>area(6+3, 8*9);
area(8 * square(4), 7);</pre>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>Variable assignment is actually just another form of expression. Assignment is done in
one of two ways--for a normal variable:<br>
<i>name</i> = <i>expression</i></p>

<p>and for an array:<br>
<i>name</i>[<i>index-expression</i>] = <i>expression</i></p>

<p>Here are a few examples: </p>

<pre>int myInt, numbers[3];
string myString;
...
myInt = 8;
myString = &quot;Animaniacs&quot;;
numbers[0] = myInt + 5;
numbers[2] = numbers[0] * 8;</pre>

<p>However, since PocketC is loosely typed, any type of value can be assigned to any type
of variable and the value will be automatically converted: </p>

<pre>myString = 95; // The value of myString is now &quot;95&quot;
numbers[1] = &quot;78&quot;; // The value of numbers[1] is now 78;
numbers[&quot;2&quot;] = &quot;2&quot;; // Another neat trick. numbers[2] is now 2</pre>

<p>Now, what are all the operators that can be used in an expression, and what is their
associativity? Good question. </p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

  </tr>
</table>
<b>

<p>Notes:</b> No shortcut logic is performed on the operands of || and &amp;&amp;<br>
The compound assignment operators (+=, *=, etc.) are not supported.<br>
The comma and conditional operators (?:) are not supported.<br>
</p>

<h3>Increment / Decrement</h3>

<p>The ++ and -- operators are special in that they must be placed before or after a
variable and modify the value of the variable. The ++ increments the value of a variable
by one, while the -- decrements by one. The caveat is that if the ++/-- is placed in front
of the variable, the expression evaluates to the value of the variable after it is
incremented/decremented. If it is placed after the variable, the expression evaluates to
the variable's previous value. Example: </p>

<pre>int myInt;
...
myInt = 8;
puts(++myInt); // Prints &quot;9&quot; to the output form

myInt = 8;
puts(myInt++); // Prints &quot;8&quot; to the output form, but myInt is now 9</pre>

<h3>Automatic Conversion and Casting</h3>

<p>Just like in assignments statements, automatic conversion takes place in every part of
an expression. If the two arguments to an operator are of different types, one of
arguments will be promoted to the less strict type. The promotion order is char to int to
float to string. So in the expression: </p>

<pre>&quot;Result is: &quot; + 5;</pre>

<p>The constant 5 is first promoted to a string, and the two strings are concatenated.
This may have some undesirable side effects. For example, if you want to write an
expression and result to the output form, you might do something like this: </p>

<pre>puts(&quot;5 + 7 = &quot; + 5 + 7); // Prints &quot;5 + 7 = 57&quot;</pre>

<p>This probably wasn't the desired outcome. Instead, you would want the expression
evaluated first, then concatenated to the string. The parentheses can be used to
accomplish this: </p>

<pre>puts(&quot;5 + 7 = &quot; + (5 + 7)); // Prints &quot;5 + 7 = 12&quot;</pre>

<p>One problem remains. Suppose you want to find the floating point value of a fraction of
two integer. </p>

<pre>puts(&quot;7 / 5 = &quot; + (7 / 5)); // Prints &quot;7 / 5 = 1&quot;</pre>

<p>This output is because both arguments are integers, so the result is also an integer.
To solve this, we can cast one of them to a float: </p>

<pre>puts(&quot;7 / 5 = &quot; + ((float)7 / 5)); // Prints &quot; 7 / 5 = 1.4&quot;</pre>

<p>This forces the integer 7 to a floating point number before dividing it by 5.</p>

<h3>Statements</h3>

<p>Statements are the individual parts that make up the body of a function. The following
are the available statements: </p>

<table border="1">

    <td><code>return;</code></td>

    <td>The expression <i>expr</i> is evaluated. If it is true (non-zero or non-empty string),
    <i>stmt</i> is executed. The loop then begin again, evaluating <i>expr</i> and executing <i>stmt</i>

    while (<i>expr</i>)</code></td>

    <i>stmt</i></code></td>

<h3><br>
Statement Examples</h3>
<b>

<p>return</b><br>
Let's visit a previous example function to see how return works. </p>

<pre>five() {
   return 5;
}</pre>

<p>Since the return value of the function <i>five</i> is always 5, we can use the function
any place we would normal put the constant 5. </p>

<pre>puts(&quot;Five is &quot; + five()); // Prints &quot;Five is 5&quot;</pre>

<p>Also, since <code>return</code> causes the function to exit immediately, we could do
this: </p>

<pre>five() {
   return 5;
   puts(&quot;This won't print&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>and we would have the same effect.</p>

<p><b>if</b><br>
</p>

<pre>lessThan5(int x) {
   if (x &lt; 5)
      puts(&quot;Less than five&quot;);
   puts(&quot;Hello&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>If this function is called with a number less than 5, &quot;Less than five&quot; will
be printed followed by the word &quot;Hello&quot;, otherwise, only the word
&quot;Hello&quot; is printed.</p>

<p><b>if ... then</b><br>
</p>

<pre>lessThan5(int x) {
   if (x &lt; 5)
      puts(&quot;Less than five&quot;);
   else
      puts(&quot;Greater than or equal to five&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>If this function is called with a number less than 5, &quot;Less than five&quot; is
printed, otherwise &quot;Greater than or equal to five&quot; is printed.</p>

<p><b>while</b> </p>

<pre>count() {
   int x;

   x = 5;
   while (x &gt; 0) {
      puts(x);
      x = x - 1;
   }
}</pre>

<p>This bit of code will print the numbers from 5 to 1 counting backwards. Notice that
braces were placed around the two lines of code in the <code>while</code> loop to make
them act as a single statement.</p>

<p><b>do ... while</b> </p>

<pre>count() {
   int x;

   x = 6;
   do {
      x = x - 1; // could also be x--
      puts(x);
   } while (x &gt; 0);
}</pre>

<p>This bit of code (similar to the previous example) will print the numbers from 5 to <b>0</b>
counting backwards. The zero is printed in this case because the expression <code>x &lt; 0</code>
is not evaluated until after the loop</p>

<p><b>for</b> </p>

<pre>output() {
   string list[4];
   int index;

   list[0] = &quot;Zero&quot;;
   list[1] = &quot;One&quot;;
   list[2] = &quot;Two&quot;;
   list[3] = &quot;Three&quot;;

   for (index = 0 ; index &lt; 4 ; index++)
      puts(list[index]);
}</pre>

<p>This example will print out &quot;ZeroOneTwoThree&quot;. When we disect it we see that
the array <i>list</i> is initialized first. We then reach the <code>for</code> loop.
First, the initializer is evaluated, setting index to 0. Next, the condition is evaluated <code>index
&lt; 4</code>, which is true, so the body of the loop executes, printing &quot;Zero&quot;.
The iterator expression is then evaluated, increasing <i>index</i> by one. This continues
until <i>index</i> is equal to 4, at which point the loop exits without executing the body
again.</p>

<p><b>break</b> </p>

<pre>count() {
   int x;

   x = 5;
   while (x &gt; 0) {
      if (x == 1)
         break;
      puts(x);
      x = x - 1;
   }
}</pre>

<p>In this slightly more complex piece of code, the counting goes on as it normally would,
printing out &quot;5432&quot;. However, when <i>x</i> reaches 1, <code>break</code> is
executed, breaking out of the <code>while</code> loop early, before the 1 gets printed.</p>

<p><b>continue</b> </p>

<pre>count() {
   int x;

   x = 6;
   while (x &gt; 1) {
      x--; // Do the subtraction first
      if (x == 3)
         continue;
      puts(x);
   }
}</pre>

<p>In this clearly contrived example, the output is &quot;5421&quot;. When <i>x</i>
reaches 3, the <code>continue</code> is executed, passing execution to the beginning of
the loop, skipping over the <i>puts</i>.</p>

<h3>Pointers</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pointers are an advanced topic, which should be dealt with after
the user is familiar with all the other programming concepts.</p>

<p>All variables are stored at some address in memory. A pointer is a variable which
refers to another variable by containing that variable's address.</p>

<p>There are two primary operators which are used with pointers, * and &amp;. The *
operator dereferences the pointer. A dereferenced pointer acts just like the data to which
it points. The &amp; operator returns the address of a given variable. To illustrate: </p>

<pre>pointer p, q;
int i;

main() {
  i = 5;
  p = &amp;i;   // Assign the address of 'i' to the pointer 'p'
            // now, typing '*p' is the same as typing 'i'
  puts(*p); // Print the value of 'i'
  *p = 7;   // Assign 7 to 'i'
  q = p;    // Assign the value of 'p', which is the address of 'i', to 'q'
            // now, typing '*q' is the also the same as typing 'i'

  // Things not to do
  p = 8;    // BAD! Don't assign a constant value to a pointer
  *i = 9;   // BAD! Don't try to dereference a non-pointer
}</pre>

<p>A pointer can also be used to take the address of a function (but NOT a built in
function!). Unlike variables, however, the &amp; operator is <strong>NOT</strong> used.
Calling a function through a pointer is a little tricky. First, the code looks ugly.
Second, <strong>no error checking can be done on the parameters</strong>, so type
conversions are not done and the number of arguments is not confirmed. For example: </p>

<pre>
func(int x) { return 5*x; }

main() {
  int result;
  pointer ptr;

  ptr = func; // Take the address of a function
  result = (*ptr)(5); // call the function (ugly)

  // Things not to do
  result = (*ptr)(&quot;5&quot;); // this won't work, since the string
                        // isn't converted to an integer
  result = (*ptr)(5,7); // this will compile, but will result
                        // in stack corruption because the
                        // wrong number of arguments are used
}</pre>
<b>

<p>Pointers and arrays</b><br>
Pointers and arrays are fairly similar. Pointers can use the [] operator, and an array
variable (when not used with []) results in the address of the first element. For example:
</p>

<pre>int array[5];
pointer p;

main() {
  p = array; // Assign the address of the first element of
             // 'array' to 'p'
  *p = 7;    // Assign 7 to array[0]
  p[1] = 8;  // Assign 8 to array[1]
}</pre>

<p>This enables the pointers to arrays to be passed as function parameters. This also
allows the user to implement their own version of two-dimensional arrays. By creating an
array of pointers, each of which is a pointer to an array (or part of one), a
two-dimensional array can be simulated. </p>

<pre>int array[100];
pointer twod[10]; // after init(), this can be treated
                  // like at 10x10 matrix

init() {
  int i;
  for (i=0;i&lt;10;i++)
    twod[i]=array + i*10; // Pointer arithmetic
}

main() {
  int x, y;
  init();
  for (x=0;x&lt;10;x++)
    for (y=0;y&lt;10;y++)
      twod[x][y]=x * y; // Sets array[x*10 + y] = x*y
}</pre>
<b>

<p>Pointer arithmetic</b><br>
Pointer values can used in a limited number of expression. You can add and subtract from a
pointer (and, thus, can use the increment and decrement operators as well). When you add 1
to a pointer, the pointer points to the next value in memory. Similarly, when you subtract
1 from a pointer, the pointer points to the previous value in memory. Caution should be
used when using pointer arithmetic, because dereferencing an invalid memory location will
cause an error in the applet. </p>

<h3>Include</h3>

<p>Using the <code>include</code> keyword, it becomes possible to write programs whose
source code is longer than te current 4K Memo Pad limit, or to create memos of frequently
used code. The contents of the included file are functionally inserted into the line
containing the <code>include</code> keyword.<br>
<b>Note:</b> An included memo can begin with '/$' instead of '//' to hide it from the
compile form.<br>
<b>Example</b> </p>

<pre>/$ MyFunctions
times5(int x) {
   return x*5;
}</pre>

<p>Another memo: </p>

<pre>// My Program
include &quot;MyFunctions&quot;

main() {
   int y;
   y = times5(7);
   puts(y); // Prints 35
}</pre>

<p>The compiler sees this as: </p>

<pre>// My Program
times5(int x) {
   return x*5;
}
main() {
   int y;
   y = times5(7);
   puts(y); // Prints 35
}</pre>

<b>Note: </b><code>include</code> can only be used at the top level (i.e. you cannot use <code>include</code> within a function)

<h3>Using Native Libraries</h3>

<p>To use the functions defined by a native library, you must first tell the compiler to
load the library by using the <code>library</code> keyword. The functions are then used as
if they were normal functions. (DO NOT use this keyword with MathLib. MathLib functions
are available as built-in functions.)</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>// My Applet
// PocketCLib defines times5(int)
library &quot;PocketCLib&quot;

main() {
   int x;
   x = times5(7);
}</pre>

<p>For information of creating native libraries, see <a href="native.html">native.htm</a>l.
</p>

<h3>Special characters</h3>

<p>There are two ways to add special characters to a string. The first is by appending
them by number, such as: </p>

<pre>str = &quot;Here is a neat little square: &quot; + (char)149;</pre>

<p>The other method is through using escape sequences. The following escape sequences are
supported: </p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Escape sequence</th>
    <th width="40">\\</th>
    <th width="40">\'</th>
    <th width="40">\&quot;</th>
    <th width="40">\n</th>
    <th width="40">\t</th>
    <th>\x</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Interpretation</th>
    <td align="center">\</td>
    <td align="center">'</td>
    <td align="center">&quot;</td>
    <td align="center">newline</td>
    <td align="center">tab</td>
    <td>character specified by the following two hex digits. Example: '\x95' is the block
    character (decimal 149)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So, to create a string that contains a quote: </p>

<pre>str = &quot;She said \&quot;I'm sorry,\&quot; but it was too late...&quot;;
puts(str); // Prints: She said &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; but it was too late...</pre>

<h3>Preprocessor</h3>

<p>Just as in C, PocketC contains a preprocessor, which allow a programmer to define
macros and conditionally compile a section of code based on the presence of a given macro.</p>

<p><strong>#define <em>macro macro data</em></strong></p>

<p>A macro is an identifier which, when read by the compiler, is replaced by the macro's
data. A macro's data can be any number of tokens (including zero). The macro data is
terminated by the next newline. For example: </p>

<pre>#define calc 5 * (x + 7)

main() {
  int x, y;
  x = 9;
  y = calc;
  puts(&quot;y = &quot; + y);
}</pre>

<p>The compiler sees this as: </p>

<pre>main() {
  int x, y;
  x = 9;
  y = 5 * (x + 7);
  puts(&quot;y = &quot; + y);
}</pre>
<b>

<p>#ifdef <i>macro</i></b></p>

<p>If the macro has been previously defined (even if it is defined to be nothing), the
section of code between it and the matching <b>#endif</b> is compiled. Otherwise, the
compiler ignores the section of code.</p>

<p><b>#ifndef <i>macro</i></b></p>

<p>If the macro has NOT been previously defined, the section of code between it and the
matching <b>#endif</b> is compiled. Otherwise, the compiler ignores the section of code.</p>

<p><b>#endif</b></p>

<p>Marks the end of a section of code preceeded by an <b>#ifdef</b> or <b>#ifndef</b>.</p>

<p><b>#else</b></p>

<p>Placed in the middle of a <b>#ifdef</b> or <b>#ifndef</b> block, the code between the <b>#else</b>
and the <b>#endif</b> is compiled if and only if the previous block was not.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>#define DEBUG

main() {
#ifdef DEBUG
  puts(&quot;In debugging mode&quot;);
#else
  puts(&quot;In normal mode&quot;);
#endif
}</pre>

<p>The compiler predefines these macros:
<pre>#define __PKTC__ 1
#define __PKTC_PALM__ 1</pre>

<p>There are also two special macros:<pre>__LINE__, the current line number
__FILE__, the currently compiling file</pre>

<hr>

<p>That should just about cover it. Next, look over the <a href="Functions.html">Built-in
Functions</a> to see which may be useful for you.</p>
