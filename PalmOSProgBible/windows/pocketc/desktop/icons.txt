Application Icons
-----------------

The easiest way to create an icon is to use and modify the included sample BMPs.
If you choose to create your own image, it must be as follows:

Large icon  - a 256 color 32x22 BMP file
Small icon  - a 256 color 16x9 BMP file

Currently, only the black and white pixels are used.
